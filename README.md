# BreadBasket
This Kaggle dataset belongs to "The Bread Basket" a bakery located in Edinburgh. The dataset has 20507 entries, over 9000 transactions, and 4 columns. The dataset has transactions of customers who ordered different items from this bakery online and the time period of the data is from 26-01-11 to 27-12-03. I have performed data cleaning and visualization in Microsoft Power BI.
**Findings**
**As shown in the graphs:**
  1.  Coffee and bread are the highest sold items in the bakery.
  2.  Afternoon and morning is the busy time of the day as per number of transactions.
  3.  The bakery has more transactions over the weekend.
  4.  Transactions are more frequent between nov-march, because more people like to have hot drinks in winters.
